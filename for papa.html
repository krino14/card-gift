			<p>Happy Birthday to the man who sacrificed so much for us. You have been through a lot pa. I am so thankful to have you as my father and I'll forever be grateful for all the hardwork and sacrifices you have made for our family. You are the reason why we am living an easy and fortunate life, if not for you we might not be able to live a fortunate life. It is not easy to stand up and bear the responsibility of raising your unborn daughter's life but you did and I admire always your hard work and dedication you put to everything. I know that the days you work has been hard and took a toll on you. I wish we could give you our strength and be there for your side pa whenever you need us. I can't wait until I'll be able to buy you the things you and mama wants. One day, I promise, I'll be able to afford all of it. So to my father and the first man I have always love,</p>
